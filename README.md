Ceaser cipher or Ceaser's code is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. In ancient Rome, Julius Ceaser used this techniq to send crypted messages to his allies.
It is method in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. As well I have used some fancy ASCII art to make it look cool. Enjoy!
